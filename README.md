### Description
Hi friends! I have been interested in learning the math behind linear regression and wanted to create my own code to solve the OLS equation from scratch. The MathematicalAndStatisticalAnalysis (MASA) library is a statistical package that focuses on linear regression, stastical testing and model evaluation. It also contains my own auto linear transformation OLS algorithm (ALTOLS) that automatically tests different fits between the x and y variables and chooses a linear transformation that leads to the highest R2. Please enjoy!

### How to use

##### Step 1
Please install the wget package which will allow you to download the MASA library directly from github. <br>
<code>pip install wget</code>

##### Step 2
Execute the below code to download the MASA library to your current working directory to then import and use in a jupyter notebook. <br>
<code>wget.download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nick12221/Mathematical-and-Statistical-Analytics/main/MathematicalAndStatisticalAnalytics.py")
</code>

##### Step 3
Download the juptyer notebook and csv file in this repository for a walkthrough of how to use the package and comparisons to production packages such as statsmodels. <br>

### Needed Packages
Only NumPy is needed to run the MASA library.
